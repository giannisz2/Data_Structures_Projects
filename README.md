# Data Structures Projects and Lab Exercises (DIT)

This repository contains my projects and lab exercises for the Data Structures course at the Department of Informatics and Telecommunications (DIT) during the Spring Semester of the 2021-2022 academic year.

These projects and exercises were completed just four months after I began programming. While they may not be entirely correct, they represent my learning journey and the progress I made during this time.

Grades for Each Project:
Project 1: 78/100
Project 2: 92/100
Project 3: 48/100
Final Grade: 7.5/10
